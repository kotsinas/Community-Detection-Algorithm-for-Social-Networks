# Community Detection Algorithm for Social Networks using Threaded Binary Trees

Undoubtedly, we are entering the era of a new universal digital state, where social networks count billions 
of users worldwide. The development and growing popularity of social media has a decisive influence on 
the consumer, political and entertainment behavior of users, thus being the subject of study of the 
modern scientific community.
This dissertation deals with the study of social networks through graph theory. Many modern applications 
are based on data graphs. Among them, a very important application of this kind is the community 
detection. As the number and size of networks modeled by graphs increase, methods that reduce the 
computational cost of this vast amount of data must be used by developing efficient applications.
This work combines data processing techniques to save computing time with standard data structures, 
such as threaded binary trees to locate communities effectively. This strategy was implemented in 
weighted real-world networks with irregular topologies with the help of Python 3.8.
The results of the application of the algorithm developed with data from the most popular social networks 
demonstrate the importance of the application of graph theory to large volumes of data and the need to 
develop effective algorithms to meet the challenges posed by modern digital reality.
